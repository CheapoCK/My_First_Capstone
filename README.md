An analysis of Singapore weather dataset for in year 2022, focusing on the Rainfall and Air Temperature data. The dashboard provides a visual and interactive platform for exploring patterns and trends in the data, helping user to gain insights into the rainfall and temperature patterns in Singapore. The dashboard was created using Microsoft Excel software and features user-friendly interface that allows user to access and interact with the data in an intuitive manner. The dashboard provides a valuable tool for data analysis, enabling user to make informed decisions based on the data.

### What have I learned from this analysis?
- The **highest rainfall** was in *October*.
- The **lowest rainfall** was in *January*.
- Top 3 **stations with highest rainfall** were *Admiralty*, *Ang Mo Kio* and *Clementi*. 
- *East Coast Parkway* station has the **lowest rainfall**.
- The **highest temperature recorded** was **36.8Â°C**, at *Admiralty* station.

### What are the changes
- Cleaning data using Power Query (remove unwanted column, create new DATE column, etc)
- Using Pivot Table to create Pivot Charts.
- Adding Slicer to filter Pivot Table, visualize the same data with different criteria.

## My insights based on the data/charts
I can make the following recommendations:
- High fall rain months: advise PUB to increase the inspection of the major drains for any obstruction to prevent unnecessary flooding.
- High average maximum temperature: advise NParks to plant more flora in Marina Barrage and Paya Lebar areas and BCA to increase incentives to building owners in these areas to expedite their buildings to become Green buildings.

### Future Improvements v2.0 (*Coming soon* ... ...)
- To add Y2021 and Y2020 dataset.
- To add Wind charts into the Dashboard for analysis.
